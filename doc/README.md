The current prototype is able to add players into the game, randomly assign them roles, 
and configure game options. Then, it allows players 
to take actions depending on their role, where Cowboys can watch over a location and bandits can choose to either rob or watch a location.
The observations allow for players to see results based on the location they chose, where Cowboys can choose to see number of players or a specific player who visited their location, bandits who watched get to see one of those choices randomly, and bandits who robbed stay at their location. 
There is also a win check if money gained in the one round exceeds the money limit set. 

The program is able to handle any inputs, and if a wrong input is given when prompted for a certain type, it will ask the user again. 

The Main method is contained in the TextUI class. All inputs are handled by a Scanner.
